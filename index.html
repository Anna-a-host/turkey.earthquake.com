        <h1>Earthquake Impact on Turkey and Syria</h1>
    <i>
        <p>
            At its core, an earthquake is a sudden <strong><a href="surge.html">surge</a></strong> of shaking of the Earth's surface caused by the occasional <strong><a href="rush.html">rush</a></strong> of energy from the Earth's crust due to the movement of tectonic plates. This is one of those natural disasters that takes lives of thousands of people. And Turkey was caught in its <strong><a href="grip.html">grip</a></strong> as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            In its most <strong><a href="insidious.html">insidious</a></strong> form, a seismic event of <strong><a href="substantial.html">substantial</a></strong> magnitude, measuring 7.8 on the Magnitude Scale, rocked southern and central Turkey and northern and western Syria. Nine hours later, at 1:24 p.m., a second earthquake of magnitude 7.5 about 95 kilometers to the northeast occurred. Then, as if the damage wasn’t bad enough, these <strong><a href="unprecedented.html">unprecedented</a></strong> earthquakes just spiralled into an <strong><a href="obliterating.html">obliterating</a></strong> cycle of <strong> <a href="relentless.html"> relentless </a> </strong> aftershocks which led to <strong><a href="mounting.html">mounting</a></strong> losses and <strong><a href="exacerbate.html"> exacerbated </a></strong> the situation as their magnitude exceeded 6.0.
        </p>
        <p>
            The duration of the earthquakes was also not just a <strong><a href="fleeting.html">fleeting </a></strong> one – the first one lasted approximately 75-90 seconds and the second one – 45-60 seconds.
        </p>

        <h2>Consequences of the Disaster</h2>
    <i>
        <p>
            Without a doubt, all these events had unalterable consequences that <strong><a href="intervene.html">intervened</a></strong> in the fate of many people and<strong> <a href="wreak.html"> wreaked</a> </strong> <strong><a href="havoc.html">havoc</a></strong>. The death <strong><a href="toll.html">toll</a></strong> from the earthquake was <strong> <a href="staggering.html"> staggering</a></strong>, exceeding approximately 50,000 individuals, including 45,968 in Turkey and over 5,900 in Syria.
        </p>
        <p>
            The issue required fostering a <strong> <a href="facet.html">multifaceted</a></strong> approach and almost nobody could maintain a <strong><a href="laissez-faire.html">laissez-faire</a></strong> attitude, so an array of people felt a <strong> <a href="compel.html">compelling</a> <a href="urge.html">urge</a></strong> to help the victims of the tragedy, especially the people who were still under the rubble and needed help.
        </p>
    </i>
        <h2>Economic and Psychological Impact</h2>
    <i>
        <p>
            The economic <strong><a href="strain.html">strain</a></strong> was substantial, with estimated damage reaching 148.8 billion dollars in Turkey and an additional 14.8 billion dollars in Syria. <strong><a href="tackle.html">To tackle </a></strong>this issue, <strong><a href="tap.html">tapping into</a></strong> additional funding, financial <strong><a href="counsel.html">counselling</a></strong> and <strong><a href="intervention.html">intervention</a></strong> by governments of other countries were required.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of these tragic events made an already <strong><a href="seductive.html">seductive</a></strong> <strong><a href="allure.html">allure</a></strong> of studying earthquakes even more attractive. Plenty of new people were <strong><a href="entrench.html">entrenched</a></strong> into studying all the facets of the earthquakes because the last one provided an opportunity to study the fault lines in the region of the disaster and the idea of <strong><a href="tailor.html">tailoring</a></strong> infrastructure to this sort of events became almost <strong><a href="compulsive.html">compulsive</a></strong>.
